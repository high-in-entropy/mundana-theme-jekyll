2020 was a year of health crisis, economic slowdown, stock market slump and bounce backs. But for India, in addition, it was also a year of increased and continued **Chinese aggression** on her Himalayan borders. The situation was so tense and aggressive at one point, that a military scuffle between the two countries led to the unfortunate martyrdom of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number on the Chinese side. India is already experiencing a rise in right-wing nationalism since the Hindu Nationalist party **BJP** came to power. 

The public outcry to the unfortunate event was naturally a negative sentiment and anger against the **Chinese establishment**. People responded by publically destroying Chinese electronic imports. Indian Government also responded by **banning** several Chinese Apps on security grounds. As intense as it sounds, India is not the only country to impose trade restrictions on the Chinese in some way or the other. President **Donald Trump** had started a full-fledged trade war with China earlier in **2018**. **Australians** also had to deal with severe trade restriction threats from the Chinese side. The **Japanese** had to deal with something similar when Chinese goods were found in their disputed territories. All-in-all there is a spread of **protectionist** ideas in some the major free-market economies around the world. The concerns of these economies is very justifiable. China, since years, has resorted to several unjust trade practices. She regularly breaks **WTO regulations** and adopts a severe **Intelectual Property Theft** causing several developed economies losses of billions of dollars. However, is protectionism and trade wars an economically vaible way to tackle the Chinese economic bullying and malpractices? This is what we discuss in the following article. 


## Trade Deficit

The heart of Indian argument to initiate protectionist measures to deal with the Chinese was a masiive **trade deficit**. India had a humongous trade deficit of $48.64 billion (2019-'20) with China. This led general public as well as politicians to make a strong case for **restricting trade with China**.

## Economics of International Trade
<br />
Different countries have advantages in production/manufacturing of different goods. Country A may be **comparatively** cheaper in producing IPhones while Country B in Rice. This is what economists refer to as **comparative advantage**. Comparative Advantage is the ability of someone to produce something at **lower costs** than others. This doesn't necessarily mean they're better at producig it. To understand this, let's take an example. Suppose I am an economist. My job entails **data collection** as well as **research** on top of it. Data Collection is a boring, tedious and time consuming job while research is the real fruit. Obviously if I am a qualified researcher I will be able to collect data easily. However the time I spend in collecting data (which is humongous) can be utilised to do research. This is what we call an **opportunity cost**. Every opportunity that we take up has some costs. Taking up time-consuming data collection job has an opportunity cost of having to forgo research, which I am better at. So what if I hire a **research assistant** to do the task of data collection? In reality I still may be better than them at collecting data but that costs me my time for research work. So the RA does the job instead of working at a low paying software role, and I do my research instead of utilising time in collecting data. This is what we call a **Comparative Advantage**. I have a Comparative Advantage of doing research while my assistant at collecting the data required.  We both are **better off** than what we were when we hadn't had each other. 

Now expand the same arguments for countries. Some countries can produce **cheaper electronic devices** whereas others can produce **cheaper clothing**. Now if they both have to produce goods which they aren't good at producing, they are at a loss. Hence, International Trade is a very effective way of **improving production capabilities** of a country. For example, thanks to the Chinese comparative advantage of producing **smartphones**, people around the world are able to buy them at a much cheaper rate and hence in turn are able to spend the money saved in other **areas of necessity** like medicines for their family. In economic terms, it is referred to as an increase in *Consumer Surplus* (CS). CS is the **difference** between amount of money consumers are **willing to spend** on a good and the actual **price** of the good. The higher the value in the positive direction, the better off consumers are. Let's look at this graphically. 

<br />

<br />
Let's consider the American market for **roses** which takes up a lot of american resources if produced within the borders because of unfaourable climate. This is a classic **Supply-Demand curve**, where supply is the firm's **willingness to supply** at a given price, while demand is the consumers **willingness to buy** at a given price. The market is said to be at **equilibrium** at the intersecting point, which in a free market economy is the price and the quantity supplied for the good. The shaded portion will point to the Consumer Surplus. Now let's consider a situation when America opens herself to **international trade of roses**.

<br />

<br />
Now the supply curve will almost be a **horizontally flat curve**, because consumers have infinite choices of markets to buy roses from. The price also **lowers** because roses are imported from a country which can produce them at cheaper rates. 
We can clearly notice the **increase in Consumer Surplus** when America opens up for international trade of roses. This is the **increased benefit to consumers** as well as the economy as whole because the total market surplus also increases, while, farmers in the rose exporting country get employed. In short, economically its a **win-win situation.**
<br />
Now let's say the American Government **imposes a tariff** to limit rose imports into the USA in a reply to some geopolitical issue. Naturally the price increases. Let's see what happens to the CS. 
<br />

<br />
As expected, the consumer surplus **reduces** a lot. This means **less medicines, less education, less expenditure** by the general public on other necessary goods. Ofcourse, in response the rose exporting country will put up her own trade restrictions and eventually this trade war leads to a situation where both the countries lose out on the benefits of International Trade. 
<br />

<br />
Initially, the USA had a **trade deficit** with the rose exporting country (imagine a rose-only trade for brevity of explanation). After trade restricitons she did reduce the trade deficit. But are Americans better off because of the reduction of the deficit? Of course not. They lost heavily on the surplus which they could have used in other necessary goods. Yes, trade deficit with a country does mean we are paying her more than what we are receiving in total, but that also means the citizens of the countries involved in trade are benefitted in other ways. So trade deficit is not an inherently bad thing like what the politicians and other stakeholders claim it to be. 


<br /><br />
## What's the way out?
<br />

While I make a point of how irrelavant trade deficit with a country is, but I also agree that the Chinese resort to some terrible trade as well as geopolitical practices. However, is simply **banning/restricting** Chinese trade a solution to deal with their aggression? Have a look at the **Chinese trade with India** and the rest of the world.
<br />

<br />
Chinese exports to India is just a meagre **3%** of its global exports. Is restricting an already meagre trade effective? In the process, we take away **benefits of Consumer Surplus** from our own public, while inflicting little to no damage on China. The only way to deal with Chinese aggression is to form an **economic alliance of all major Chinese importers** so that they together put pressure on the Chinese establishment. Unless the **free, democratic world** is scattered, simplistic and naive trade restrictions from one country isn't going to change anything. 
<br />
However, the election of **Joe Biden** as the **46th President of the US** brings some hope. One of his foreign policy is to bring together all the **democratic free world**, in order to tackle the chinese menace. As I am writing this article, there is a government transition happening in the US. It will be interesting to see what the election of a liberal, democratic, outward looking American President brings to the table of geopolitical affairs.
